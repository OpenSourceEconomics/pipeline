Installation
============

.. Same as in README.rst.

**pipeline** is available on Anaconda.org. Use the following command for installation.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
    $ conda install -c opensourceeconomics respy

If you plan to use R templates as well, type

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda config --add channels r
    $ conda install rpy2<3 tidyverse stargazer

to get started with the least amount of packages.
